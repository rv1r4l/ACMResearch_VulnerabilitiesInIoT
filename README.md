# Finding Security Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices

The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about a revolution in connected devices, making our lives more convenient and efficient. However, as more and more devices are connected to the internet, the risk of security vulnerabilities increases. In this research project, we will be focusing on identifying security vulnerabilities in IoT devices and exploring potential solutions to address these vulnerabilities. By finding and addressing these vulnerabilities, we can improve the overall security of the IoT ecosystem and protect against malicious attacks.

Whether these devices be smart security cameras to car keys, hacking these devices can give users and companies a better idea of what we can do to make our devices safer to use.
